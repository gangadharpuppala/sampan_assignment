Production Line Tracking System
This web application tracks production data for four production lines across three shifts, including product production, line speed, total production, and energy consumption. Built with FastAPI and an RDBMS, it provides a user-friendly UI(HTML & CSS) for data entry and a dashboard to monitor key KPIs such as total production, energy usage, and trends over time.
